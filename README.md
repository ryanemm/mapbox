Safer

This project is aimed at creating a safer environment for the South African public. A location based application that crowd sources information on crime instances from users. Users report instances of crime occuring with the specific location allowing an algorithm to determine the high risk areas and locations. This allows users to consider a particular area or restaurant's safety rating before visiting. Crimes are reported according to the category of crime which is particularly useful as the application intends to make it easier for sexual crimes and gender based violence instances to be reported as they are severely under reported due to the stigma associated with them.
